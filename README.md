# discord-glyphbot
sample code to detect homoglyphed names in discord

this code only warns admins/mods via the discord assigned system channel (wherever you receive discord official communications). a bot operator can add desired action such as assigning a particular role for action, forcing a new nick (e.g. "potential scammer"), kicking, or banning.
